# Unit-4-game
The purpose of this game is to reach the set goal number. Using simple math the user can figure out the worth of each image to reach the desired score.

Press on the four images to increase your score.
Images are usually different numbers.
They change number each round.
To win the game you must get the exact number as the goal.
You lose the game if you go over.
The win and lose score will show in the counters at the bottom of the page.
Once you win or lose the game will go on to the next round.

I created a var that contained the character and image that the user could click on. I had set the value to 0 to start with. For the start function I had the valuse for each image to set to random. I then added a function to add onto their number each time they click until they reach the goal value. The check function is an if, else if to check if the user has gone over the goal value or got the exact match.
